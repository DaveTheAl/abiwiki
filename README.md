# abiwiki
A Platform for IB-Students to collaborate knowledge elegantly, beautifully, easily and most importantly understandably!

This was my first project trying to use my HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL skills to build a 
data-driven website with a secure login-module. The only real framework used was CKEditor and jQuery for the Animations.
Have fun exploring!
